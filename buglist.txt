1. isEmpty always returns true regardless of the number of elements in the linked list
2. removeBack does not alter the linked list.
3. removeBack does not change the size of the list.
3. removeFront does not alter the linked list.
4. removeFront does not change the size of the list.
5. addBack adds to the front of the list instead of the back.
6. The destructor doesn't work properly and there are memory errors.

  The methods above seem to be the only ones that are broken. The fact
  that these are broken do affect some of the other methods though. For
  example, it is likely that the destructor doesn't work because isEmpty
  always returns true.
